# Bitcoins-Prediction


I took my data from online cite which shows the Bitcoins daily price. My data is for one month. In time series
prediction we deal with Bitcoins as stock. The problem with stock that it has not main predictors that affect
the target variable even the date. It is not seanality in other word it is stationary. A stationary data set does
not affected by time which the series observed. In data below I have 5 columns, which are:
- Date: the day for the price.
- Price(closed) : the fainal price.
- Open: the first price for the stock.
- High: the highes price.
- Low: the lowest price.
